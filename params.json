{"name":"Gui-mail-reader","tagline":"My M.tech First year project.","body":"# Gui-Mail-Reader\r\nDescription : In this project, we have done UI similar to Squirrel Mail. However, unlike in Squirrel\r\nMail, we have done only reading text mail facility. This involves understanding the mailbox format,\r\nparsing it and extracting the From, Date, Subject fields and displaying them in a form that shows\r\nthese as columns. The subject field is clickable and when it is clicked, it should open another form\r\nthat shows the contents of the mail along with all the other headers of the mail such as CC, etc. The\r\nmail box can be on a different system and has to be contacted using a client-server program.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
