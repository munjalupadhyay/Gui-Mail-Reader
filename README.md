# Gui-Mail-Reader
Description : In this project, we have done UI similar to Squirrel Mail. However, unlike in Squirrel
Mail, we have done only reading text mail facility. This involves understanding the mailbox format,
parsing it and extracting the From, Date, Subject fields and displaying them in a form that shows
these as columns. The subject field is clickable and when it is clicked, it should open another form
that shows the contents of the mail along with all the other headers of the mail such as CC, etc. The
mail box can be on a different system and has to be contacted using a client-server program.
